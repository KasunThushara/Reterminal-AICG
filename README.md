AI content Generation -News enhancer 

1. Initialize API keys and libraries (NewsAPI, OpenAI, pygame, etc.).

2.Define functions for speech recognition, extracting country and category from recognized text, retrieving news, generating enhanced news bullets from GPT-3.5 model, and creating the news ticker animation using Tkinter.

3. Create the Tkinter window and add labels and buttons for user interaction.

4. When the “Recognize” button is clicked, the Speech recognition function is called, disabling the button and starting the speech recognition process in the background.

5. The background thread continuously reads audio input from the microphone, performs speech recognition, and updates the GUI label to indicate the recognition status.

6. If the speech is recognized successfully and contains valid country and category information, the application fetches news articles using the NewsAPI and generates enhanced text using the GPT-3.5 model.

7. The generated speech is played using pygame, and the news content is displayed in a news ticker animation on the Tkinter window.

8. The animation loops, moving the news content from right to left until the entire text is displayed.

9. The user can speak again to trigger another speech recognition process.
